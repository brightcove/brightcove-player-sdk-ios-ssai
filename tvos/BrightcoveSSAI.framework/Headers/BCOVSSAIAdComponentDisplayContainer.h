/**
 * This class is used to display the ad UI and handle companion ads for BCOVSSAI.
 *
 * The UI includes a banner displaying the countdown until content starts and the learn more button
 * and a skip button for skippable ads. This object only added the ad view to the hierarchy
 * when an ad is going to be played, and it is removed when the ad is complete.
 *
 * When an ad contains companions, this object will attempt to match the width
 * and height of those companions with the width and height of the BCOVSSAICompanionSlots
 * managed by this object. If no match is found, the companion will not be populated.
 * If a match occurs, the companion slot will remain populated until another ad
 * with a matching companion slot takes its place.
 *
 * After creating this object, it must be added to the playback controller as a session
 * consumer via `-[BCOVPlaybackController addSessionConsumer:]`.
